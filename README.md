Just me playing around with android development studio and creating a simple app for it
It's basically just does a tiny fibonacci calculator for the nth number in the sequence
I did this so I know Kotlin well enough to write a recursive function with a wrapper aroung it

nothing complicated, and the UI isn't good, but that's not the goal
